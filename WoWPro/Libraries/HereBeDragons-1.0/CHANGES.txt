    Fix map info for the dreamgrove and true shot lodge on first login
    
    These maps can only be opened when you are on the appropriate class,
    which unfortunately also means that right during login they are not
    accessible yet until the game figures out which class you are.
    
    The only missing/wrong info in these cases is the C/Z information, so
    exempt them from the remapping code and hardcode the correct Z.
