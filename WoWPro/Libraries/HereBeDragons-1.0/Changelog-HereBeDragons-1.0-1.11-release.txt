Tag as 1.11-release


--------------------

Hendrik Leppkes:
	- Fix restoring the map in multi-level micro dungeons
	- Fix restoring the current map location while in micro dungeons
	- Make the timed update upgrade safe and avoid having multiple active timers
	- Run a timer to catch floor changes in multi-level micro dungeons
	Multi-level micro dungeons do not reliably fire any events when traveling
	between different floors, so instead run a one second timer to keep
	updating the map location while inside a micro dungeon to catch those
	changes.
